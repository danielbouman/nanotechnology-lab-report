\section*{Conclusion}
Several samples were created with the AZ~5214~E resist, using both the positive and negative tone. Several different exposure times were used to find an optimum for contact lithography with the MJB-3 machine and a development procedure with the MF-321. For positive tone, the optimal exposure time was estimated to be 2 minutes, resulting in a resolution of around 2-10 $\mu$m. For negative tone, the optimal exposure time was estimated to be 4 minutes, though there were not enough samples done near this range to estimate it correctly \todo[inline]{ik weet niet of het gepast is om een schatting voor de resolutie zomaar neer te zetten.}.

Optimal resolution should be ...

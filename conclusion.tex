\section*{Conclusion}
Several samples were created with the AZ~5214~E resist, using both the positive and negative tone. Several different exposure times were used to find an optimum for contact lithography with the MJB-3 machine and a development procedure with the MF-321. For positive tone, the optimal exposure time was estimated to be 2 minutes, resulting in a resolution of around 2-10 $\mu$m. For negative tone, the optimal exposure time was estimated to be 0.4 minutes, though there were not enough samples done near this range to estimate it correctly. The resolution for the negative tone for $\tau_1 = 0.5$ was found to be around 20-40 $\mu$m. Comparing this with the theoretical result $R = k \sqrt{\lambda\frac{z}{2}} \approx 7 \mu$m, which shows that 2.0 minutes for the positive tone is almost optimal, while 0.5 minutes for negative tone is far from optimal.

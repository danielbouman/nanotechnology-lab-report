\section*{Introduction}
Optical lithography is a process used to transfer geometric\todo[inline]{is 'geometric' echt nodig?} patterns from a photomask to a photosensitive resist. Optical lithography is widely used in academia and industry to fabricate miniature\todo[inline]{beetje dubbelop,  'miniature' en 'micrometer or nanometer'} structures of micrometer or nanometer scale. In this report the effects of and differences between a positive tone and a negative tone resist is investigated.

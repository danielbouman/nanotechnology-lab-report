\section*{Introduction}
Optical lithography is a process used to transfer patterns from a photomask to a photosensitive resist. Optical lithography is widely used in academia and industry to fabricate structures on a micrometer or nanometer scale. In this report the effects of and differences between a positive tone and a negative tone resist is investigated.

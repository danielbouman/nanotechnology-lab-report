\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{Recipe}
Primer \todo[inline]{wat voor primer?} is deposited by hand on top of a silicon wafer and spun for \todo[inline]{wat voor recipe? hoe lang en hoe hard wil je hem hebben?} minutes at ???? RPM. The primer is baked on a hot plate at 200$^{\circ}$~C for two minutes. Then AZ5214 \todo[inline]{dubbelchecken of dit wel de juiste resist is, okay?} is used as the resist layer by depositing it on top of the primer and spinning it with the same recipe as the primer. The resist is baked on a hot plate at 90$^{\circ}$~C for one minute. The sample is then exposed to a close contact/proximity \todo[inline]{welke van de twee is het?} exposure for a variable amount of minutes, after which it is developed for a minute in \todo[inline]{???} and then development is stopped by rinsing the sample in water.

Up to the exposure, the negative resist recipe is the same as that for the positive resist. After exposure the negative resist is baked for crosslinking the polymers.

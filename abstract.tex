In this report we investigate the effects of using AZ 5214 E as both positive and negative tone resist for creating microstructures using optical contact lithography. We varied several parameters of the existing recipes to get optimal results with a MJB-3 mask aligner. Optimal exposure times for positive tone resist were found to be around 2~min. For the negative tone resist an initial exposure of around 0.4~min. and a flood exposure for 4~min were found to be optimal.

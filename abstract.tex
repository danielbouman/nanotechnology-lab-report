\begin{abstract}
The AZ 5214 E resist was used as a positive and negative resist for micrometer scale patterns, which were fabricated using contact lithography with an MJB-3 mask aligner. There was no known recipe with the used resist and light frequency, which motivated using different exposure times to find the optimal exposure time. Keeping all other parameters fixed for the recipe, it was estimated from microscopy analysis that the optimal exposure times were 2.0 and 0.4 minutes for the positive and negative tone, respectively.

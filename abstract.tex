The Schr\"{o}dinger equation is a partial differential equation that governs the time-evolution of the wavefunction for a given potential and is of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics. The (non-relativistic) Schr\"{o}dinger equation is solved numerically in one and two dimensions with the Crank-Nicolson method for a variety of potentials. The potentials used were chosen to mimic certain physical situations or to compare the simulation with analytical solutions.

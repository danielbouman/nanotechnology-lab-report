\section*{Conclusion}
The simulations performed agree very well with prior expected results, both from a physical and a mathematical point of view. The program could be improved in several places, however:

\begin{itemize}
\item Variable $a$ and $\tau$ during the simulation. This would be beneficial for simulating systems with sudden jumps in the potential, like the double slit potential.
\item Implementation of time-dependent potentials. This was not implemented since most known results in quantum mechanics are for time-independent potentials, making it hard to compare with known results.
\item In the simulation the wavefunction is expressed in real space. By Fourier transforming it is possible to express the wavefunction in momentum space. Another possibility would then be to simulate the Wigner quasiprobability distribution in time, which is the quantum analog of a probability distribution in phase space.
\end{itemize}
